# Open Your Creativity!

### 5 open-source software applications for creative/productive work that I recommmend.

## 1. Blender
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a complete 3D animation and asset creation suite. It is highly extensible and customizable out of the box, supporting scripts and add-ons provided by the community. It has a wide range of capabilities besides just modeling, and animation, such as sculpting, video editing/compositing, and advanced physics simulation, just to name a few.

## 2. Godot
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is an advanced game engine that competes with state-of-the-art proprietary game engines such as Unity. It is completely free to use and modify, and there are no licensing or royalty fees, unlike other well-established game engines. Many highly commercially successful games have been developed using the Godot engine.

## 3. LibreOffice
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) gives you all the functionality of popular office software as seen from companies like Microsoft or Google. You can make documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc, and it even has cross-compatibility with proprietary formats (such as Microsoft's docx). There are many extensions available to download for LibreOffice that allow you to extend the capabilities of the software.

## 4. Krita
[Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is an excellent digital art program that comes with all the features you'd hope for in drawing software. The program has a wide variety of brushes, filters, and blend modes out of the box. As with every other program in this list, you can install plugins to extend Krita's functionality and features.

## 5. Inkscape
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a great alternative to programs like Adobe Illustrator for vector graphic design. It is highly powerful and intuitively designed for working with curves and shapes. Inkscape extensions allow you to, as you probably already guessed, extend the functionality of the software even further.
