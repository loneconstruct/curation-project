# Open Your Creativity!

### 5 open-source software applications for creative/productive work that I recommmend.

## 1. Blender
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a complete 3D animation and asset creation suite. It is highly extensible and customizable out of the box, supporting scripts and add-ons provided by the community. It has a wide range of capabilities besides just modeling, and animation, such as sculpting, video editing/compositing, and advanced physics simulation, just to name a few.

## 2. Godot
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is an advanced game engine that competes with state-of-the-art proprietary game engines such as Unity. It is completely free to use and modify, and there are no licensing or royalty fees, unlike other well-established game engines. Many highly commercially successful games have been developed using the Godot engine.

## 3. LibreOffice
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) gives you all the functionality of popular office software as seen from companies like Microsoft or Google. You can make documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc, and it even has cross-compatibility with proprietary formats (such as Microsoft's docx).

## 4. Krita
[Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is an excellent digital art program that comes with all the features you'd hope for in drawing software.

## 5. Inkscape
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a great alternative to programs like Adobe Illustrator for vector graphic design. While it may lack some of the extra features found in programs like Illustrator, it is extremely powerful and intuitively designed for working with curves and shapes.
