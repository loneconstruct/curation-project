# Open Your Creativity!

### 5 open-source software applications for creative/productive work that I recommmend.

#### What is meant by "open-source?"
> Software is written in a human-readable progamming language before it is then *compiled,* that is, translated into a language only computers can understand (ones and zeroes). After a program is compiled, it is not possible to know exactly what that code is doing if one does not have access to the human-readable *source code.* Most software we use today is proprietary and *closed-source,* meaning the company/entity that owns said software has not made their source code available for public viewing. This allows for software developers to get away with executing potentially malicious code, without the average user noticing. *Open-source* software, on the other hand, is software which has publicly-available source code that anyone can view and vet for themselves. Generally, source code is stored in what is known as a *repository,* which is typically stored online. As a matter of fact, the page you are currently reading this from **is** a repository! While there is no code to be found here, I chose this medium to stay consistent to the theme of the project. 


## 1. Blender
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a complete 3D animation and asset creation suite. It is highly extensible and customizable out of the box, supporting scripts and add-ons provided by the community. It has a wide range of capabilities besides just modeling, and animation, such as sculpting, video editing/compositing, and advanced physics simulation, just to name a few.

## 2. Godot
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is an advanced game engine that competes with state-of-the-art proprietary game engines such as Unity. It is completely free to use and modify, and there are no licensing or royalty fees, unlike other well-established game engines. Many highly commercially successful games have been developed using the Godot engine.

## 3. LibreOffice
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) gives you all the functionality of popular office software as seen from companies like Microsoft or Google. You can make documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc, and it even has cross-compatibility with proprietary formats (such as Microsoft's docx). There are many extensions available to download for LibreOffice that allow you to extend the capabilities of the software.

## 4. Krita
[Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is an excellent digital art program that comes with all the features you'd hope for in drawing software. The program has a wide variety of brushes, filters, and blend modes out of the box. As with every other program in this list, you can install plugins to extend Krita's functionality and features.

## 5. Inkscape
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a great alternative to programs like Adobe Illustrator for vector graphic design. It is highly powerful and intuitively designed for working with curves and shapes. Inkscape extensions allow you to, as you probably already guessed, extend the functionality of the software even further.
